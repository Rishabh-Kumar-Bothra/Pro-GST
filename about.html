<h1>What is GST? Goods & Services Tax Law Explained for Beginners!</h1><br><br>
<h3>What is GST?</h3>
<p>Goods & Services Tax is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that will be levied on every value addition.
    To understand this, we need to understand the concepts under this definition. Let us start with the term ‘Multi-stage’. Now, there are
    multiple steps an item goes through from manufacture or production to the final sale. Buying of raw materials is the first stage.
    The second stage is production or manufacture. Then, there is the warehousing of materials. Next, comes the sale of the product to the retailer.
    And in the final stage, the retailer sells you – the end consumer – the product, completing its life cycle.</p>

    <p>Now, Goods and Services Tax will be levied at every point of sale. Assume that the entire manufacture process is happening in Rajasthan
        and the final point of sale is in Karnataka. Since Goods & Services Tax is levied at the point of consumption, so the state of Rajasthan
        will get revenue in the manufacturing and warehousing stages, but lose out on the revenue when the product moves out Rajasthan and
        reaches the end consumer in Karnataka. This means that Karnataka will earn that revenue on the final sale, because
        it is a destination-based tax and this revenue will be collected at the final point of sale/destination which is Karnataka.</p>

    <h2> Why is Goods and Services Tax so Important?</h2>
    <p>Currently, the Indian tax structure is divided into two – Direct and Indirect Taxes. Direct Taxes are levies where the liability cannot
        be passed on to someone else. An example of this is Income Tax where you earn the income and you alone are liable to pay the tax on it.

        In the case of Indirect Taxes, the liability of the tax can be passed on to someone else. This means that when the shopkeeper must pay
        VAT on his sale, he can pass on the liability to the customer. So, in effect, the customer pays the price of the item as well as the VAT
        on it so the shopkeeper can deposit the VAT to the government. This means that the customer must pay not just the price of the product,
        but he also pays the tax liability, and therefore, he has a higher outlay when he buys an item.

        This happens because the shopkeeper has paid a tax when he bought the item from the wholesaler. To recover that amount, as well as to
        make up for the VAT he must pay to the government, he passes the liability to the customer who has to pay the additional amount.
        There is currently no other way for the shopkeeper to recover whatever he pays from his own pocket during transactions and therefore,
        he has no choice but to pass on the liability to the customer.

        Goods and Services Tax will address this issue after it is implemented. It has a system of Input Tax Credit which will allow
        sellers to claim the tax already paid, so that the final liability on the end consumer is decreased.</p>

    <h2>How does GST work?</h2>
    <p>When Goods and Services Tax is implemented, there will be 3 kinds of applicable Goods and Services Taxes:<br>
<ul>
      <li>CGST: where the revenue will be collected by the central government<br></li>

    <li>SGST: where the revenue will be collected by the state governments for intra-state sales<br></li>

     <li>IGST: where the revenue will be collected by the central government for inter-state sales<br></li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <table class="table-responsive table table-hover">
        <tr>
            <th>Transaction</th>
            <th>New Regime</th>
            <th>Old Regime</th>
            <th>Comments</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sale within the state</td>
            <td>CGST + SGST</td>
            <td>VAT + Central Excise/Service tax</td>
            <td>Revenue will now be shared between the Centre and the State</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sale to another State</td>
            <td>IGST</td>
            <td>Central Sales Tax + Excise/Service Tax</td>
            <td>There will only be one type of tax (central) now in case of inter-state sales. </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>The idea behind having one consolidated indirect tax to subsume multiple currently existing indirect taxes is to benefit the Indian
        economy in a number of ways:
<ul>
    <li>It will help the country’s businesses gain a level playing field</li>
    <li>It will put us on par with foreign nations who have a more structured tax system</li>
    <li>It will also translate into gains for the end consumer who not have to pay cascading taxes any more</li>
    <li>There will now be a single tax on goods and services</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the above,
        <ul>

       <li>The Goods and Services Tax Law aims at streamlining the indirect taxation regime. As mentioned above, GST will subsume all indirect
    taxes levied on goods and service, including State and Central level taxes. The GST mechanism is an advancement on the VAT system, the idea
           being that a unified GST Law will create a seamless nationwide market.</li>
       <li>It is also expected that Goods and Services Tax will improve the collection of taxes as well as boost the development of
           Indian economy by removing the indirect tax barriers between states and integrating the country through a uniform tax rate.</li>
</ul>
