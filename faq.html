    <h2>Does aggregate turnover include value of inward supplies
        received on which RCM is payable?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Refer Section 2(6) of CGST Act.
        Aggregate turnover does not include
        value of inward supplies on which tax
        is payable on reverse charge basis.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>What if the dealer migrated with wrong PAN as the status
        of firm was changed from proprietorship to partnership?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;New registration would be required as
        partnership firm would have new PAN.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>A taxable personâ€™s business is in many states. All supplies
        are below 10 Lakhs. He makes an Inter State supply from
        one state. Is he liable for registration?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;He is liable to register if the aggregate
        turnover (all India) is more than 20 lacs
        or if he is engaged in inter-State
        supplies.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>Can we use provisional GSTIN or do we get new GSTIN?
        Can we start using provisional GSTIN till new one is issued?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Provisional GSTIN (PID) should be
        converted into final GSTIN within 90
        days. Yes, provisional GSTIN can be
        used till final GSTIN is issued. PID &
        final GSTIN would be same.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>Whether aggregate turnover includes turnover of supplies
        on which tax is payable by the recipient under reverse
        charge?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Outward supplies on which tax is paid
        on reverse charge basis by the
        recipient will be included in the
        aggregate turnover of the supplier.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>Is an advocate providing interstate supply chargeable
        under Reverse Charge liable for registration?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Exemption from registration has been
        provided to such suppliers who are
        making only those supplies on which
        recipient is liable to discharge GST
        under RCM.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>I have enrolled in GST but I forgot to enter SAC codes.
        What should I do? The status is migrated.</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;The same can be filled while filing
        FORM REG-26 for converting
        provisional ID to final registration.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>Whether a separate GSTIN would be allotted to a
        registered person for deducting TDS (he has PAN and TAN
        as well)?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Separate registration as tax deductor is
        required.</h4><br><br>

    <h2>If a company in Maharashtra holds only one event in Delhi,
        will they have to register in Delhi? Will paying IGST from
        Maharashtra suffice?</h2><br>

    <h4>&#9658;Only if you provide any supply from
        Delhi you need to take registration in
        Delhi. Else, registration at Mumbai is
        sufficient (and pay IGST on supplies
        made from Mumbai to Delhi)</h4><br><br><br>
